<h1>Homework 7: Interactive Map </h1>
<h2>Kenza Hessini</h2>
<h3>This map shows the ratio between the enrolled population in schools and the total population (3 and above). I decided to do this ratio to see how many students there are compared to the total population. This helps us to see how many people aren't enrolled in school that potentially could be. This shows how much of the population is not enrolled in school. All these maps look relatively similar but the different classifications represent the data in a different way.</h3>
