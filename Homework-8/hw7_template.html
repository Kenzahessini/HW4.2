<h1> Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Kenza Hessini</h2>
<h3>My question was: How many Chapel Hill buildings are in a 1000ft buffer from the highway. Highways pose health risks, both sound and pollution to nearby buildings, mostly those 1000ft from the highway. The geoprocessing tools I used were the buffer, for the 100ft from the highway and intersect for the buildings in the buffer. I also used intersect for the buildings and highway to have them just be in Chapel Hill instead of all of North Carolina. I found that there are 6098 buildings in the 1000ft buffer while there are 13452 in Chapel Hill as a whole. This means that 45% of buildings are in the buffer and potentially at risk for pollution from the highways.<h3>
